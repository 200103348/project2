                <h1>Tokyo Olympics  2021</h1>
                <div>Kazakhstani athletes won 96 tickets to the Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo in 27 sports. The National Olympic Committee of Kazakhstan summed up the results at the end of the qualifying and rating competitions of the Tokyo Olympics. As a result, our Olympic team includes 95 athletes.</div>
                <div>The Olympic Games in Tokyo will start on July 23, and a total of 339 sets of medals will be competed in the main competition of the four-year period.</div>
                <div>For the first time, Kazakhstan will participate in the Olympic program in newly entered sports, in particular, rock climbing and karate. Five athletes will compete in karate at once: Darkhan Asadilov, Nurkanat Azhikanov, Daniyar Yuldashev, Moldir Zhanbyrbay and Sofia Berultseva, and Rishat Khaibullin in rock climbing.</div>
                <div>The leader of the National Olympic team will undoubtedly be a well-known Kazakhstani track and field athlete Olga Rypakova. This will be the fourth Olympic Games in Olga's sports career. Today, he has a full set of Olympic medals in his piggy bank. At all previous Olympic Games, he returned with a prize.</div>
                <div>The men's water polo team is the only Kazakhstani team to participate in the competition in team games. They returned to the Olympic Games after an eight-year break.</div>
                <div>Traditionally, the men's boxing team, led by Kamshybek Konkabayev, will take part in eight weight classes in full. Nine tickets in the country's piggy bank belong to boxers.</div>
                <div>Gymnast Milad Karimi successfully completed the qualifying round, winning seven tickets alone.</div>
                <div>We won three trips from swimming. Two of them belong to Olympic champion Dmitry Balandin.</div>
                <div>Our compatriot Ruslan Kurbanov was among the six athletes who won the continental quota according to the individual rating of the International Fencing Federation. For the first time after the Olympic Games in Athens (2004), three cyclists of Kazakhstan will compete in group competitions. Team leader Alexey Lutsenko made a great contribution to achieving such a result. He brought Kazakhstan a score that has not been scored by any of the countries of the Asian continent in general. He won three licenses in Track Cycling (sprint, Omnium and keirin). It should be noted that the ticket for this sport is historical for Kazakhstan. Because until now, Kazakhstani athletes have not participated in the Olympic Games in this discipline.</div>
                <div>For the first time in 20 years of archery, three archers from Kazakhstan will take part in team competitions at the Olympic Games.</div>
                <div>Today, eleven tickets belong to wrestlers, and track and field athletes have already won licenses in this amount. There are seven tennis players in the basket, and six kayaks and canoes in the basket. According to the results of the rating competitions, judoists received six tickets. Among the tatami masters who will compete in Tokyo, there is an experienced Eldos Smetov.</div>
                <div>The national team of Kazakhstan received two licenses in Table Tennis, as well as two licenses in taekwondo and slalom rowing.</div>
